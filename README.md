# TODO List Kata

TODO list applications are quite popular these days. They help you get organized. Today you will write your own one.
This Kata is divided into two parts. 
First do the base feature part without even looking at the additional features. 
Once the foundation is ready then move forward to the list of features.

Focus on developing one feature at a time and commit every time is done.

#Base features

The objective is to write a piece of code that will be capable of:

    returning the list of tasks;
    creating a new task;
    deleting an existing task.

To be clear at this point neither persisting between subsequent program runs nor UI is required. Just the working engine.
